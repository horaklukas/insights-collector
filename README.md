# Insights collector

> Application for collecting reports about your websites performance using [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)

I created this application when trying [Elm](https://elm-lang.org).

## Develop it
Run app in development mode `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

## Running by yourself
**Copy all files from `dist` directory into root of your server.**

You can change list of pages in `db.js` file to adjust which webpages will be analyzed.
